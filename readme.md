# Predicting Forest Fire Severity with Multiple Regression Models

This project aims to predict forest fire severity based on various meteorological and environmental factors. The dataset used is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, featuring data from forest fires in Portugal. Multiple regression models were applied to predict the severity, with performance evaluated using **RMSE** and **RÂ²**.
