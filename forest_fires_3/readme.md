After applying sample weights, the model performance results show some improvements and some areas of concern. Here's a closer look at the results:

### Key Observations:
1. **Linear Regression**:
   - **Test RMSE**: 108.39 (similar to before)
   - **Test R²**: 0.003 (still very low)
   - **CV RMSE**: 2162.38
   - **Analysis**: Despite applying sample weights, the performance of linear regression did not show a notable improvement. The R² value is still close to zero, indicating the model is not explaining much of the variance in the target variable. The RMSE is also high, indicating large errors.

2. **Random Forest**:
   - **Test RMSE**: 109.78 (similar to before)
   - **Test R²**: -0.022 (still negative)
   - **CV RMSE**: 2877.67
   - **Analysis**: Random Forest performance also did not significantly improve after applying sample weights. The R² remains negative, suggesting the model is underperforming compared to a baseline model. The RMSE remains large, and the cross-validation RMSE is high, indicating that the model may still struggle to generalize well.

3. **XGBoost**:
   - **Test RMSE**: 111.71 (similar to before)
   - **Test R²**: -0.058 (still negative)
   - **CV RMSE**: 4720.38
   - **Analysis**: XGBoost also shows little improvement, with a negative R² and a high RMSE. It appears that this model is not handling the target imbalance effectively, even with sample weights.

4. **Decision Tree**:
   - **Test RMSE**: 95.36 (improvement from before)
   - **Test R²**: 0.229 (positive R² improvement)
   - **CV RMSE**: 6903.12
   - **Analysis**: Decision Tree performance has improved compared to before, showing a decrease in RMSE and a positive R². However, the cross-validation RMSE is very high, suggesting that while the model fits the training data better, it might be overfitting, or it is not generalizing well.

5. **Gradient Boosting**:
   - **Test RMSE**: 107.81 (slightly improved)
   - **Test R²**: 0.014 (positive but still low)
   - **CV RMSE**: 4808.74
   - **Analysis**: Gradient Boosting shows a slight improvement in RMSE, but the R² remains low, indicating that the model is still not capturing much of the target variable's variance. The cross-validation RMSE suggests the model is struggling with generalization.

6. **Support Vector Regression**:
   - **Test RMSE**: 110.12 (similar to before)
   - **Test R²**: -0.029 (negative, no improvement)
   - **CV RMSE**: 2189.86
   - **Analysis**: Support Vector Regression does not show an improvement after applying sample weights. The negative R² suggests that this model is not performing better than a simple baseline.

7. **K-Nearest Neighbors**:
   - **Test RMSE**: 107.13 (similar to before)
   - **Test R²**: 0.026 (slightly better, but still low)
   - **CV RMSE**: 2480.02
   - **Analysis**: K-Nearest Neighbors also does not show significant improvement. The R² is still low, and RMSE is high.

### Conclusion:
1. **Decision Tree** has shown the most improvement after applying sample weights, particularly in reducing the RMSE and achieving a positive R². However, the **high cross-validation RMSE** suggests that the model is not generalizing well and might be overfitting the training data.

2. **Other models**, such as **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, **Linear Regression**, and **Support Vector Regression**, still show poor performance even after applying sample weights. They struggle with both overfitting (high CV RMSE) and underfitting (negative or low R²).

### Next Steps:
1. **Model Tuning**: Tuning hyperparameters of the models, especially Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest, might help improve generalization.


In short, sample weighting did not drastically improve performance across all models, but it had some beneficial effect on certain models like Decision Tree. Further experimentation and adjustments in data handling and model tuning may be needed for better results.
