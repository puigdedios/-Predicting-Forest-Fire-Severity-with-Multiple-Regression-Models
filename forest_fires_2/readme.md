The analysis reveals several notable insights and potential issues with the dataset that need addressing:

## How to Run the Code

To run the code in a Colab notebook, use the following commands:

!wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/puigdedios/-Predicting-Forest-Fire-Severity-with-Multiple-Regression-Models/main/forest_fires_2.py !python forest_fires_2.py

Here's a more concise and structured version of your README content with the key points clearly outlined:

---

### **1. Target Variable: High Proportion of Zero or Near-Zero Values**

- **Issue:**  
  Over 53% of the target variable (`area`) values are zero or near-zero (<=1). This indicates a class imbalance, where most instances have either no fire or small fire areas.  
  When the target variable has a large proportion of zero or near-zero values, predictive models often struggle to generalize to larger fire areas, leading to poor performance in predicting significant events.

---

### **2. Skewness in the Target Variable (`area`)**

- **Key Observations:**
  - **Mean vs. Median:** The mean (`12.85`) is much higher than the median (`0.52`), indicating strong positive skewness.
  - **Zero/Small Values:** 53% of the data points are <=1 ha, showing a concentration near zero.
  - **Outliers:** The maximum value (`1090.84`) is much higher than the 75th percentile (`6.57`), indicating the presence of outliers.

- **Implications:**
  - The dataset is imbalanced for regression. Models may focus too much on predicting small values, resulting in poor generalization for larger fire areas.
  - Extreme outliers can disproportionately influence models, especially linear regression.

- **Summary of Statistics:**
  - Min = 0, Max = 1090.84, Mean = 12.85, 25th Percentile = 0, Median = 0.52
  - High standard deviation (63.66) indicates a spread between small and large values.

### **3. Class Imbalance in Predictors**

- **Month Distribution:**
  - Most data is concentrated in August (184) and September (172), with a steep drop-off for other months like March (54), July (32), and November (1).
  - **Implication:** The model might overfit to patterns in the most frequent months and struggle with underrepresented months.

- **Day Distribution:**
  - The distribution is more balanced, with slight skewness toward Sundays (95) and Fridays (85).
  - **Implication:** This imbalance is less of a concern compared to months.

### **What We do to Address These Issues?**



2. - **Sample Weighting: Many machine learning algorithms allow the use of sample weights to adjust the modelâ€™s loss function.
